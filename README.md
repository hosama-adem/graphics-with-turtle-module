# Graphics with Turtle Module

> In 2025, during summer, I explored drawing graphics with Python’s `turtle` module.

## About

This repository contains several graphical projects built using Python’s built-in **turtle** module. It’s a learning journey in creating visual art and animations with simple code.  
Examples include spirograph drawings, “turtle racing”, and more creative visual experiments.

## Features / Projects Included

- **Spirograph**: Generate spirograph patterns via loops and circular motions  
- **Turtle racing game**: Simple animation / game where turtles “race”  
- **Hirst painting** (or dot painting inspired by Damien Hirst)  
- Other drawing experiments  

Each script demonstrates techniques like looping, turning, color control, and randomness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Standard library (no external dependencies, since `turtle` is part of Python)  

## How to Run / Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hosama-adem/graphics-with-turtle-module.git
   cd graphics-with-turtle-module
